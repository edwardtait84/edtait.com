        <p class="biography"><b>Enterprising New Year</b><br>Blog Post from January 21st 2024</p>
        <br><p class="biography">A lot has a happened over the last few weeks, and I’ve not written for a while now. My diary’s been filled up with many concerts, personally-run projects, and a couple more university auditions and open days, over the next couple of terms. I think it’s fair to say that my composition career is finally taking off! I’m also slowly working on a big essay, which I’ll publish online as soon as I can. (I’d predict likely around March or April? I don’t know exactly yet.) I think it’d be good to gain an academic presence in music as well.</p>
        <br><p class="biography">I’m starting to finally build a great career and the prospects of a great life, since I’ve got a girlfriend who I love and who loves me dearly, a great supportive family, and LOADS of supportive friends, who I can thank for this. On reflection, I think I can attribute a lot of this to Purcell alone. In the 6 or 7 years I’ve been here, it’s done wonders for me! I’ve changed so much and grown up so much more than at anywhere else, and am so grateful for the love and support I’ve had from everyone here, teachers, colleagues, partners, and friends. I’ve also notable changed a lot in my view of composition, as I’ve explored a lot over the last year in my blog.</p>
        <br><p class="biography">These past 3 or 4 months have, for me, been filled with a strange sort of balance of confusion, excitement, worry, guilt, uncertainty, pressure, and hope. I get weird moments of excitement when things and plans start to fall into place, like offers, journeys, open days, deals, career advances, and of course, personal plans, but at the same time, I have times when I completely lose sight of that, and question my plans, choices, and what I’m going to do. In the process, I’ve made many sacrifices, but I guess that’s how we mature, and it’s all part of growing up.</p>
        <br><p class="biography">I’ve been thinking about the possibility of studying law as my postgraduate degree, like a conversion course. Part of me says that I should go for that, for reasons mentioned previously, but the other half says different. A lot of people tell me that I wouldn’t take music seriously if I studied law and became a lawyer, which I don’t exactly see as true, and on balance, I think I’d be smart enough to study law, with a lot of work, obviously. The main problem is how it would fit into my life. Would I do music primarily, or law primarily, or both? Would doing both even work?</p>
        <br><p class="biography">To put that aside, however, I’ve got quite a range of offers from University and Conservatoire, which are Music at York, Music at Nottingham, Liberal Arts at King’s, and for Conservatoire, a Composition major at Royal Academy, Royal Northern, and Royal Welsh. For the sake of auditions, open days and my applications, I’m not yet going to comment on the preferred choices, until at least a few months away. However, one thing I can say is that I’ve planned out an ideal life with my dream university/conservatoire in mind, which I’ve finally settled on.</p>
