        <br><p class="biography">I'd like to give a mention to one of my favourite pieces of music at the moment, which is The Planets by Gustav Holst. When talking about this subject, my composition teacher Jacques Cohen described The Planets as “a fantastic suite of seven unique tone poems”, which I agree with completely, and I think that sums up a lot of the reason as to why I love them so much. I'm even thinking about arranging it for solo piano, as I've been putting together some sketches straight onto the piano, which I might write up onto Sibelius.</p>
        <br><p class="biography">Jacques is an amazing composition teacher. He'll say phrases like “anyway, we digress…” and “short is fine, short is good” which, from now on, I'll never be able to forget, even after I leave the Purcell School, as part of my process of composition! Whenever I remind him, at the start of each week's lesson, of which pieces I was working on, he had this facial expression, which merged into one of either ambiguity or confusion. I couldn't put my finger on it, by which point he'd remember anyway.</p>
        <br><p class="biography">He would use emotive language, in the context of anything we were working on, but in a “factual” way, almost never, until this point at least, using a strong voice or expression, keeping precisely to the point. What a legend! Samuel Kemp, Josh Gearing, and myself are all quite good friends, as we collectively made up the majority of Jacques's regular students. All of us know his uniquely personal obsession with the green paper cups used at school, mostly for drinking tea and coffee out of, which for some reason we remember!</p>
