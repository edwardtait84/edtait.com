        <p class="biography"><b>A Twist of Fate</b><br>Blog Post from September 6th 2023</p>
        <br><p class="biography">This week has been packed. I met the most amazing girl, named Kat. It became pretty clear and really quickly that we both liked each other. However, meanwhile, I know who I'm actually friends with now. That's become clear, as so many of my old friends have dropped all hopes with me and befriended all the new people, and some have stuck beside me, particularly people like Yulin, who I want to particularly call out, as he's been so selfless and always around to support me, like no other friend I've had before.</p>
