        <p class="biography"><b>Categorization of Style</b><br>Blog Post from February 6th 2024</p>
	<br><p class="biography">I’ve come across quite an important revelation, which I see as quite important in my developing years as a composer. A few days ago, just before I turned 18, I found out that I hadn’t been accepted into any of the Chamber Music Concerts at my school. Although these concerts are centred around the performance rather than the composition, any composer who enters their own music knows the value and significance of having their work played at these concerts, particularly somewhere like Wigmore Hall.</p>
	<br><p class="biography">I originally thought that this was down to popularity, as the two other composers whose pieces had got through were both naturally far more “popular” at school, with both students and staff. At the same time, at multiple times in my recent memory, I’ve noticed that my music has grown in popularity with people outside of the world of music, which is interesting to note, as after all, I don’t try to “please” anyone, and my music could be seen as more “accessible” or to “English pastorale”, perhaps to its own faults. That’s something which I’m not sure about, but fine by me, at least it reflects a large number of people who like and appreciate my music!</p>
	<br><p class="biography">Now things evidently are beginning to change in my views, as I’ve been thinking about who I try to please with my own music and my career. At the end of the day, to be a really successful composer, I’ll need to stand out, and that doesn’t mean necessarily through the biggest concert halls like Wigmore. If anything, it emphasizes how I’m not easy to be categorized into a single strand of composition. While starting off as a classical composer, I’ve also done film and electronic, which I hope to do far more of in the future.</p>
	<br><p class="biography">My ultimate point is that my musical future shouldn’t have to live up to the expectation of playing at places like Wigmore or the Southbank Centre, or anywhere just in the “classical world”, because who knows where else I’ll go aside from that. I’m happy with who I am as a composer, and am looking forward to my future ahead of me!</p>
