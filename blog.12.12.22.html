        <p class="biography"><b>An English Teacher</b><br>Blog Post from December 12th 2022</p>
        <br><p class="biography">I need to reflect on my time studying with, and what I've so far learned from my new English teacher, Mr. Adam Simmonds. This term alone has brought me enough to shape my new view of life, as not knowing exactly what I want to do as a career in the future, but as long as I believe in the power and importance of art.</p>
        <br><p class="biography">I only partially remember his first few classes, and that most of it was simply occupied with learning about and understanding the context behind pre-Civil War, or “antebellum”, American literature. I did, however, notice his unique style of teaching. Even just the way he explained the cultural divide between Northern and Southern states, which, although I knew a lot of it already, I really started to understand a more human and psychological perspective, rather than just a string of events and historical facts.</p>
        <br><p class="biography">But it took me a while to actually put my finger on exactly what I found intriguing about his lessons, and what gave me a great amount of anticipation in what I’d discover with the next lesson, almost every lesson. Now at least I know, that after all these years of doubt, I've definitely picked the right school!</p>
