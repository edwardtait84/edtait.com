        <br><p class="biography">I'm thinking of planning concerts to perform my String Trio and arrangement of The Planets. I'd better get in there early before I run into the classic procrastination mode. Under my belief that music is the greatest and purest form of art, I've had a thought. If music is unique for being the only art form that's measured in time, then interactive music can only diminish music's unique power. It also takes away so much of the composer's identity from his own music.</p>
        <br><p class="biography">Maybe tech's the route of this. Attention spans for most can't cover any works of art longer than 5 minutes, and art can't be appreciated if it's not recognised or heard in full, because if a work of music is structured properly, then it should, by nature, feel incomplete when listening to it in sections.</p>
