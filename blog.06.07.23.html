        <p class="biography"><b>Two Last Days with Mr Simmonds</b><br>Blog Post from July 6th 2023</p>
        <br><p class="biography">This is my second-last lesson with Mr. Simmonds, and he tells me that he was a composer when he was a student at Keele. This led to a long conversation about university. I've been comparing conservatoire and university up until this point, but he said that I've got the right idea thinking more about university. As an artist himself, I half-believed him when he said that all the activity and speculation around the music of today happens when you get to university.</p>
        <br><p class="biography">He even helped me personally as a composer, saying that I need to find my own personally voice, or musical language. As I've come to agree, every composer must have their own language of writing, as it's what gives them their purpose towards art. We inevitably got onto Shostakovich, who's music I love at the moment, and I discovered that he played the cello in Shostakovich's Fifth, which he also loved.</p>
        <br><p class="biography">Our last lesson with him really completed the cycle of what I needed to know my place as a composer. He showed us a couple of his compositions from his days as a student, a violin sonata, and a piece for wind quintet. Following on from that, as we summed up our year's work of studying, he gave us all some of the best advice and reassurance we could ever need:</p>
        <br><p class="biography">“Whatever anyone will tell you, what I'm about to tell you is so important; the true way to measure a society is by its treatment, its attitude towards its art. And most art doesn't impact a lot of people, and that's fine, that doesn't matter. Every piece of art, or work of literature, or piece of music that you create will have an impact. It'll raise a question, or state an idea. And this is, I can't stress enough how important that is, to us as humans. That's why what you, all you people do as musicians, like all artists, is so important.”</p>
        <br><p class="biography">All I can say from that, is that one thing can be certain. whatever the future brings for me, or whatever I study, or work for, or whoever I'm friends with, and whoever I know, or am associated with, I'll never separate from my music, or give up my art. My music is my expression, my identity, my lifelong passion, and at the end of it all, my legacy, and nothing, no force in the world, can block me from that asset.</p>
        <br><p class="biography">I gave him a copy of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, signed by everyone in that small class of six of us. We then shook hands, and he wished me good luck! I really wish I'd thanked him more, as much as he's really helped me.</p>
