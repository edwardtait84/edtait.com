        <p class="biography"><b>Notation, Composition and Loyalty</b><br>Blog Post from November 12th 2023</p>
        <br><p class="biography">I've often been asked why there are numerous tiny technical and notation errors on my published scores. On the whole, I like to think of my scores as really well-polished and neat, but at the end of the day, I don't think anyone's really going to care about errors this tiny, and it's a waste of time re-exporting and re-uploading new versions of scores, when that could be spent on far better activities, like getting commissions and being artistic. As long as it's clear, readable, and every instruction on the score is clearly obvious, it's fine. So I think my simple answer to that question is as simple as you could've imagined. It doesn't matter!</p>
        <br><p class="biography">Being a composer. It's the most important job in the world, at the moment, in my opinion. I think this because I believe that the most important reflection on our society is art, and the purest and supremist form of art is music. Almost every philosopher I can think of agree with that last statement, that no art form can be purer and deeper and more meaningful and uncontained and beautifully ambiguous than music. And who ultimately shapes the world of music? It's the writers and composers and producers of music. It's also a form of identity for so many people, particularly more amongst non-musicians, again, in a bigger way than any other art form.</p>
        <br><p class="biography">My plan in the future is to have 3 parallel careers. One in music, one in web development, and one in law. There are inevitably going to be plenty of overlaps, such as film productions which I plan to do. However, I'm primarily a composer, and that's really what I've hoped to be for about 10 years. My view on composition has inevitably changed, but still similar in principle, and is now more about legacy, difference and enlightenment above everything else. I want to be remembered and looked up to in a way much more striking and spiritual and artistic than anything else, even law, technology, business, finance, and everything else really.</p>
        <br><p class="biography">My true testament to my loyalty to my musical existence would be my 2 upcoming concerts on 30th November and 5th December. I'm playing piano in both. One of them is my own piece, and one's my arrangement of Saturn by Holst. If I can successfully perform both, and rehearse and direct all my other pieces in these concerts in the same way, then I'll finish my career at Purcell in a way better than ever before! That's my goal for the next few weeks, which are now basically just a massive buildup to those concerts!</p>
