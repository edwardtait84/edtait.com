          “From the moment we contacted Ed he was professional in setting
          up meaningful lessons with our 15 year old son who is studying
          GCSE Music. We took a course of 6 composition lessons and some
          were at our home and some in his fabulous family music room in
          Amersham. He guided our son through many aspects of the
          curriculum teaching and encouraging him to gain a level of
          confidence in this requirement for GCSE. The difference in our
          son’s ability was incredible and he is doing exceptionally
          well in school in this module. We can definitely recommend Ed.”

          “Edward is a talented and inspiring teacher. When he started
          teaching me, I have grown into enjoying piano more and
          practising more than before. During a lesson, I sometimes made
          mistakes or played on the wrong fingerings, he always helped
          fix it and made sure I understood it before we moved on. He has
          introduced me to some challenging pieces that I really enjoy
          playing at the moment.”
