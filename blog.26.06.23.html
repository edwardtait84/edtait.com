        <p class="biography"><b>IMPULSE and Inspiration</b><br>Blog Post from June 26th 2023</p>
        <br><p class="biography">I just finished the IMPULSE outreach trip with school. A nice experience and all that, and I made some more valuable friendships, but overall, I'm sorry to say, a fucking waste of time. I spent the first 2 days teaching children, in front of my own teachers and the kids' teachers, how the conductor waves his stick around. I then had to conduct music with an ensemble who didn't help me at all by doing all the incredibly hard stuff like watching the conductor, or actually reading tempo markings.</p>
        <br><p class="biography">However, I had some good talks with my friends, particularly Oscar and Rocco, but also Antonia, who I'm finally beginning to get on good ground with. I also met a composer named Tim Ambler. Despite him being a retired retailer and 'amateur' (using his own words) composer, he probably taught me more than many of my music teachers from Purcell. He admired my capacity to take on a side career, in order to make money, and in fact heavily encouraged me to do so, as he did, when he ran offices in Marylebone. He was also so humble, describing his own music as 'cowpat' music, or 'country' music, which I believe to be a massive oversimplification of how beautiful and well-crafted his music is!</p>
        <br><p class="biography">This reminds me of my meeting and inspiring seminar with Errolyn Wallen, who taught me about the importance of personality, identity and life in music, and how it's a composer's “duty” to replicate everything in the music of their own. She was also genuinely the first person in my life who asked me the big question of “Why do I write music?”</p>
        <br><p class="biography">It was only shortly before that seminar that I had a big revelation. In a seminar with former Purcellian Reuben Bance, I was inspired to write a piece about space, which then evolved into sketches for an 8th movement to The Planets, a piece which I'd originally heard performed by my school back in early December, and by this point had become absolutely obsessed with. I started writing sketches for the whole piece, and a full opening section, with a string passage. On composing this opening, I realized that it was one of the best bits of music that I'd ever heard, and it wasn't done by a dead composer, but was written be me! This made me realize, or more accurately, rediscover that I could write so well, leading me to rediscover all the great things, related to composition, that I'd done in the past. This all started a huge revelation within me, that lasted these 3 or 4 months since, and is still, to an extent, still a subject of subtle debate within me to this day.</p>
        <br><p class="biography">It was always meant to happen, I believe, as at the end of the day, I'm a composer. That's my identity, my humanity and my existence.</p>
