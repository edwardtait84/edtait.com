    <p class="text">Yesterday, I wrote a poem about the American folklore, the Windigo. As the first poem I wrote in about 3 years, it was alright. I think I’ve still got quite a way to go, however. Christmas is just a few days away. Coming to an end, it has really made me realize that I haven’t done anything near what I wanted to achieve this year. I feel like I sort of backed out of A-levels, and could have absolutely done a lot better. I’m at a great place where I am, even if not York, but I still feel as though I haven’t got much to show for myself. I’ve been writing this book, on and off, about the village of Highbury. I’m hoping that could become something. My website-making service is kind of coming back to kick me. I’m quite behind on a couple of websites that are supposed to be finished within a few days. Maybe it’s not for me. I enjoyed it for a while, but maybe I should just focus on my own, and a select few others, in my own free time. The very first one I made, for a trio of friends at Academy, I’ve had to take down anyway, as they’re splitting up.</p>

    <p class="text">It is approaching midnight, and the new year, and therefore, I have a random thought to share, that I've been pondering over for a while. When I was at Purcell, I remember there was a big push amongst composers to try and find out "voice" and artistic identity. I even got criticised many times for writing music that was too "similar in style" to other composers. This is, to an extent, the sad case where I'm studying at the moment, at the Academy. I always felt that it doesn't matter what "style" I write in, because hopefully after a while, my voice will shine through, without me even having to try.</p>
