        <p class="biography"><b>An Unexpected Masterpiece</b><br>Blog Post from November 17th 2023</p>
        <br><p class="biography">I don't know whether to dedicate my newly-finished Fantasia-Elegy to Katrina or Tom. One's been the best girlfriend I could've asked for, but the other is mainly a clarinettist himself. Also though, on reflection, he's been such a selfless and caring friend to me all this time I've known him. I finally feel I can always go to him when I need to go to someone I can truly trust. The piece itself, particularly the ending at least, I feel musicalizes the lifelong comfort and heart-warm of a friend, in a more direct and personal way than ever.</p>
        <br><p class="biography">Then again, I could say this about so many people who I appreciate all in different ways for their supportive impact of my life, care, support, and help in growth as an artist and as a person. There's so many I could mention, but I'd like to call out Rocco, Ivan, Oscar, Dexter, Yulin, Ostap, Ashton, Louis, Sam, Samuel, Josh, Tom, Katrina, Yu-Wei, Dima, Jayden, Reuben, Antonia, Adi, Holford, as he's known, Cole, Aaron, and Rhys, above many others. And of course, so many teachers and mentors, as well as my parents and brothers, I'd include Mr Bambrough, Mrs Cox, Mr Longstaff, Mr Darrell Pigott, Mr Adam Simmonds, and of course, the legendary Jacques Cohen.</p>
        <br><p class="biography">I'm writing all of this with the ear worm of my Elegy, again mostly the heartwarming ending section, going round and round, particularly when reflecting on all these thoughts of inspiration and friendship. I guess that means it is a work of genius after all!</p>
