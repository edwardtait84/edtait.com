        <p class="biography"><b>The Long Night</b><br>Blog Post from November 14th 2023</p>
        <br><p class="biography">Here's a genuine question. Who would actually genuinely care if I disappeared off the face of the earth? I can only think of two, or maybe three people who I think genuinely do. To be fair though, I've had a rough day and I just feel really shit now. One of my friends doesn't want to care or spend time with me anymore. Other things like that have plagued me for the whole day, and even yesterday, to be honest.</p>
        <br><p class="biography">I've had several panic attacks over the last couple of months. With university applications, social problems, my new relationship, and an ongoing musical identity crisis, it's been quite stressful and conflictive for a lot of the term, particularly over the past few weeks. About the original question, maybe I just need some sleep, and then I'll be able to see things more positively tomorrow. I'll try that, and see if that helps.</p>
