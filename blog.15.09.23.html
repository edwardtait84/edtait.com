        <p class="biography"><b>Identity of a Composer</b><br>Blog Post from September 15th 2023</p>
        <br><p class="biography">There's a word that I heard spoken once in a special way, by my former English teacher, Mr. Simmonds. That word is identity. Now it's been pointed out to me, it's popped up in almost every great work of art I've ever come across within the past 10 years. Even films like Empire of the Sun and Once Upon a Time in America, and of course, above all, in my opinion, music. While writing my String Trio, I was constantly aware of my influence, as in, composers whose music that piece would not be the same if it weren't for. Every composer must find their “voice”, but my question is about what is the route of a composer's “voice”?</p>
        <br><p class="biography">I'm starting to figure out that it's the identity of a composer that ironically shapes their individualism. My String Trio, for example, although having been influenced and shaped by such a large range of music that I've listened to, somehow feels more personal to me than anything else in the world. The world to me can throw me anything, but I still won't have the heart to change my piece, or in fact, any piece I've ever written.</p>
        <br><p class="biography">At the same time as writing this, I'm hearing the Menuet from Ravel's Sonate for the first time, and somehow, I'm already filled with the feeling that it's one of the nicest pieces I've genuinely heard before! Maybe that just serves to show that music and its beauty and fulfilment is completely endless.</p>
        <br><p class="biography">I actually can't wait to play piano in concert again. From memory, it's such a good feeling, as in, the whole process of learning a piece that I care about, whether I've written it or not, and playing to others. Sharing the never-ending sphere of music means that it'll never die out!</p>
