    <h2>About the Festival</h2>
    <p>The <strong>MetroLand Music Festival</strong> is a new not-for-profit chamber music festival, raising money for Barnardo’s, a charity that means a great deal to us and the communities we serve. We are based around the historic Metroland region, and feature concerts in Amersham, Chalfont St Giles and Harrow Weald. We showcase up-and-coming young musicians, including students and graduates of the most prestigious conservatoires and universities.</p>
    <p>We like our concerts to appeal to a diverse audience, and they are therefore often themed around timeless topics which are at the heart of our world. We are especially dedicated to performing new music by emerging young composers, and we are in the process of setting up an annual Young Composers Award, to nurture the performance of new music.</p>
