                <p>Katrina Keyek is an American composer and saxophonist. She was born in 2006 in Florida, however she spent most of her life in Austin, Texas. At the age of 10, Katrina started to learn the saxophone and she was an established member in multiple wind ensembles and saxophone quartets, making Region and Area state bands a few times. When she was 16 her interest in trying new things had led her into an interest in composition. In 2023 she was offered a place at the Purcell School for Young Musicians in the United Kingdom for composition and has had regular one-on-one lessons with Simon Speare for composition, as well as her regular one-on-one saxophone lessons with Amy Green and Naomi Sullivan. While at Purcell she had a great number of performances which include performing in the Purcell’s saxophone quartet at St. Albans cathedral and having pieces premiered by different ensembles like the Purcell wind orchestra for her piece “Nostalgia”. Katrina has also been proactive in putting on concerts of her own with collaboration within Purcell including other composers and performers, most notable is her “Around the World” project. While Katrina is still in her early career of composing and performing, she focuses greatly in learning many different techniques and styles to compose for, as well as trying to combine them together to create pieces full of color.</p>
