        <p class="biography"><b>Sudden Departure</b><br>Blog Post from April 17th 2023</p>
        <br><p class="biography">My long-time history teacher, Mr. Pigott, has just announced to us that he's leaving. It's apparently not confirmed, according to a student at school, but I'm pretty sure it almost definitely is. In all seriousness, I'm going to miss him. He was well-read and well-spoken, and was a great source of inspiration to me over the years, in more than just history. He was also an inspiration to me, strangely, in music, railways, and just generally regarding my interests during my growing up.</p>
        <br><p class="biography">He was often hilariously sarcastic and satirical and cynically of plenty of things, in the funniest way that you can imagine, and often even just through his facial expressions. Also, he often replied in his knowledgeable wisdom “no, no, difference is good; some variety is good…” and would go on to explain his opinion and thoughts through his massive brain-based library of knowledge. He'd been fine, in fact comedically enthusiastic, just like my English teacher Mr. Simmonds, about any of us, although me and Dexter in particular, bringing cups of tea into class.</p>
