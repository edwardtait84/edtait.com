				<p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Symphonic Transcriptions</b></p>
				<p>Edward and several other composers are in the ongoing process of re-imagining and arranging the greatest orchestral works for the accessibility and convenience of the solo piano. They plan to have concerts roughly twice a year, with one concert having already taken place in December 2023, featuring Edward's arrangement of <i>The Planets</i> suite by Gustav Holst, the first of its kind.</p>
				<p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Composers Parallels</b></p>
				<p>This project saw two chamber works by Dmitri Shostakovich being performed alongside two new pieces by Edward Tait and Antonia Zadrag, both of which were strongly influenced by him in different ways. In the next installment of the project, titled <i>Triple Sonata</i>, Jacques Cohen, and his former students Samuel Kemp, Josh Gearing and Edward Tait each write a movement of a full suite, each taking influence from Bach Prelude in C major. The Sonata will receive its full premiere in later 2025.</p>
				<!-- FORTNIGHT PROJECT
				<p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Fortnight</b></p>
				<p>For 14 straight days, a group of composers and instrumentalists, including Edward, each write a 1-minute piece to be played and recorded by one of the other composers on their own instrument. These recordings are uploaded daily to Instagram and TikTok, and eventually, complete recordings of the 14 pieces on YouTube.</p>

				<p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>ImprovForty</b></p>
				<p>After experimenting with large-scale improvisation in his film <i>Amersham Summer</i>, Edward initiated a project, in which he recorded a new improvisation every day on the piano, for 40 days straight, with the aim of improving his pianistic fluency over that time. These improvisations were uploaded to YouTube every day. This project inspired a spin-off project, Edward Harris-Brown's <i>ImprovFifty</i>, following a similar model to the original. Tait himself followed with his own spin-off, a series of improvisations called <i>Scriabi-visations</i>, focusing on improvising in the style of Alexander Scriabin, one of his favourite composers.</p>
				<!-- HIGHBURY SERIES
				<p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Highbury</b></p>
				<p>Edward is the author of the best-selling children's book <i>Highbury</i>, and the subsequent successful series of books that followed it, all published by Austin Macauley Publishers, since 2025.</p>

				<!-- AMERSLIP VALLEY
				<p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Amerslip Valley</b></p>
				<p>He set up the model railway exhibition <i>Amerslip Valley</i>, alongside his co-founder Rhys Stokes. He additionally composed the ambient music, which provided the background soundtrack to the exhibition.</p>
