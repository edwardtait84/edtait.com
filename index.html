				<p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Symphonic Transcriptions</b></p>
				<p>Edward and several other composers are in the ongoing process of re-imagining and arranging the greatest orchestral works for the accessibility and convenience of the solo piano. They plan to have concerts roughly twice a year, with one concert having already taken place in December 2023.</p>
				<p>Click the link <a style="text-decoration: none; color: red;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUkqPyzqPEI&t=0s">here</a> to listen to Edward's arrangement of Holst <i>The Planets</i> for solo piano.</p>
				<p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Composers Parallels</b></p>
				<p>One of the great composers is performed, alongside at least two new pieces which have been strongly influenced by this composer in different ways. A recent pairing was the chamber music of Dmitri Shostakovich with two new chamber works by Edward Tait and Antonia Zadrag, near the end of their time at the Purcell School.</p>

				<p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Fortnight</b></p>
				<p>For 14 straight days, a group of composers and instrumentalists, including Edward, each write a 1-minute piece to be played and recorded by one of the other composers on their own instrument. These recordings are uploaded daily to Instagram and TikTok, and eventually, complete recordings of the 14 pieces on YouTube.</p>
