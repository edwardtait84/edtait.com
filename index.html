				<p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Symphonic Transcriptions</b></p>
				<p>Edward and several other composers are in the ongoing process of re-imagining and arranging the greatest orchestral works for the accessibility and convenience of the solo piano. They plan to have concerts roughly twice a year, with one concert having already taken place in December 2023.</p>
				<p>Click the link <a style="text-decoration: none; color: red;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUkqPyzqPEI&t=0s">here</a> to listen to Edward's arrangement of Holst <i>The Planets</i> for solo piano.</p>
				<p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Composers Parallels</b></p>
				<p>One of the great composers is performed, alongside at least two new pieces which have been strongly influenced by this composer in different ways. A recent pairing was the chamber music of Dmitri Shostakovich with two new chamber works by Edward Tait and Antonia Zadrag, near the end of their time at the Purcell School.</p>
				<p>Listen to the full recital:<br>Shostakovich ▪ <a style="text-decoration: none; color: white;" href="https://youtu.be/oX_3JqEsq3w?si=b4KohWfiEziD9H0Q">Piano Trio No. 1</a><br>Edward Tait ▪ <a style="text-decoration: none; color: white;" href="https://youtu.be/k7OmdEDs96g?si=GOz0J-Z-ISlJWy0j">String Trio No. 1</a><br>Antonia Zadrag ▪ <a style="text-decoration: none; color: white;" href="https://youtu.be/3MEJvY2yHis?si=Zfv1ils8L85mgmz5">Smutki</a><br>Shostakovich ▪ <a style="text-decoration: none; color: white;" href="https://youtu.be/9hOKjN8q8uA?si=NtPj5JjJxwD55TmO">String Quartet No. 8</a><br></p>
				<p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Fortnight</b></p>
				<p>For 14 straight days, a group of composers and instrumentalists, including Edward, each write a 1-minute piece to be played and recorded by one of the other composers on their own instrument. These recordings are uploaded daily to Instagram and TikTok, and eventually, complete recordings of the 14 pieces on YouTube.</p>

				<p><i>I always look forward to hearing Edward’s compositions, and once again I liked his Herbstlied, which was a pleasure to learn and perform.</i></p>
				<p>– Yazdi Madon, who premiered his <i>Herbstlied</i></p>
				<br style="-webkit-user-select: none; -ms-user-select: none; user-select: none;">
				<p><i>Everything you write is always very thought through, it feels like everything has its place, and it’s the perfect mix of sounding fresh and contemporary while still being accessible and enjoyable to listen to!</i></p>
				<p>– Tom McDonnell, who premiered his <i>Allegretto</i>, <i>Fantasia-Elegy</i> and <i>Eclogue</i></p>
				<br style="-webkit-user-select: none; -ms-user-select: none; user-select: none;">
				<p><i>Edward is a highly talented, enterprising young composer and has been an invaluable member of The Purcell School’s Composition Department for 7 years. During this time, Edward’s own work has developed and matured in numerous directions, and he has composed a great deal of fascinating original music for the many different creative projects run by the school over the years.</p>
				<p>As a member of the sixth form, Edward is also now curating his own concerts, each having a different focus, including not only his own work, but also compositions by other students in the Composition Department. The concerts are carefully organised and very well presented and always give additional opportunities to the school’s young composers and performers.</p>
				<p>Edward will be leaving The Purcell School in July 2024 to study in further and higher education. I am confident that he will become one of our future musical entrepreneurs and wish him all the very best for the future.</i></p>
				<p>– Alison Cox OBE, Head of Composition during his time at the Purcell School</p>
				<br style="-webkit-user-select: none; -ms-user-select: none; user-select: none;">
				<p><i>A mesmerizing and innovative metamorphosis of one of the most imposing and impenetrable works of symphonic music. Every sonority and musical gesture is preserved, yet reimagined for the piano. Intimate and austere in approach, this transcription breathes new life into a colossal masterpiece and adds a new layer of expression by reinventing it for the piano.</i></p>
				<p>– Leo Lupascu, who premiered his arrangement of <i>The Planets</i></p>
				<br style="-webkit-user-select: none; -ms-user-select: none; user-select: none;">
				<p><i>Edward’s compositions have never failed to amaze me, with his works showing a nostalgic feel reminiscent of the works of great composers such as Britten, yet also showcasing a unique and individual stamp.</i></p>
				<p>– Rhys Stokes, who premiered his <i>Mo Li Hua</i> and <i>Fleeting Manhattan</i></p>
				<br style="-webkit-user-select: none; -ms-user-select: none; user-select: none;">
				<p><i>Performing Edward’s new composition was a great opportunity for me. The orchestra did well to keep up, and I was fond of all the colours that came out of the composition! Always kept on your feet, exciting atmosphere, and I highly recommend you give it a listen.</i></p>
				<p>– Joshua Gearing, on premiering <i>Crenark Hill</i></p>
				<br style="-webkit-user-select: none; -ms-user-select: none; user-select: none;">
				<p><i>Undoubtedly a very exciting upcoming compositional voice. Works with such a strong character and a unique integrity. It was an absolute pleasure for me to hear some of Edward’s early works and I will follow his future career with great interest.</i></p>
				<p>– Samuel Kemp</p>
				<br style="-webkit-user-select: none; -ms-user-select: none; user-select: none;">
				<p><i>Ed has an exciting future ahead as a composer, as demonstrated by the excellent craftsmanship shown in Crenark Hill. It’s a very clever piece, both playful and majestic, and was a pleasure to perform.</i></p>
				<p>– Daniel Hogan</p>
				<br style="-webkit-user-select: none; -ms-user-select: none; user-select: none;">
				<p><i>His music is one of the most, if not the most, interesting type of music that I have seen in my entire generation, full of creativity, imagination and emotions.</i></p>
				<p>– Herman Cerisha</p>
				<br style="-webkit-user-select: none; -ms-user-select: none; user-select: none;">
				<p><i>Chorleywood Orchestra was delighted to premiere Edward Tait’s ‘Crenark Hill’ in a recent concert. The vision of a Scottish band marching across a massive hill was represented by two contrasting themes – introduced separately then later combining and contrasting with harmonic clashes and offsets rhythms to build up to an exciting climax with a surprise ending. Crenark Hill was fun to play and very well-received by the audience. I could see it becoming one of a suite of pieces with a slightly quirky take on folk music from different regions of the UK.</i></p>
				<p>– Andrew McFarlane, review on <i>Crenark Hill</i></p>
				<br style="-webkit-user-select: none; -ms-user-select: none; user-select: none;">
				<p><i>I am glad I had the opportunity to perform Edward’s new composition. His new Prelude for Violin and Piano can bring a challenge to the musicians. The highlight is the use of the pentatonic scale and different modes, which is what makes it so great fun to work on.</i></p>
				<p>– Dominic-Lucian Drutac, review on <i>Prelude for Violin and Piano</i></p>
