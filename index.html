				-->
				<p>Edward Tait is a 19-year-old British composer, currently studying at the Royal Academy of Music, under the tutelage of Gareth Moorcraft and Louise Drewett. He has also benefited from further guidance from Eleanor Alberga, Phil Cashian, Aaron Holloway-Nahum and Rubens Askenar. He recently won 1st Prize in the Composition category of the Tiziano Rossetti Competition in February 2025. A number of his works are published by NoteWelder Music, including his solo violin suite <i>Triptych</i>, and several of his solo piano arrangements, such as Holst’s <i>The Planets</i> and Debussy’s <i>Nocturnes</i>. Current projects include a symphonic suite, commissioned by the Chorleywood Orchestra, for a performance in 2026, and a new work for solo viola, for a friend at the Royal College of Music.</p>
				<p>After being granted a UK Music and Dance Scheme Scholarship to The Purcell School of Music in 2017, he studied with acclaimed composers Deborah Pritchard, Brian Elias and Jacques Cohen. He has had a number of orchestral works performed by the Purcell Symphony Orchestra, including <i>Trireme</i> (2019) and <i>Mo Li Hua</i> (2022). Most recently, his orchestral work <i>Fleeting Manhattan</i> was conducted by Nicholas Daniel, alongside both the Purcell School and Orion Orchestras, receving its premiere at St. John’s Smith Square in February 2024. Fleeting Manhattan went on to be shortlisted in the European Recording Orchestra’s 2024 Call for Scores.</p>
				<p>Edward has had countless performances in-and-around London, including premieres of two of his compositions at Hatfield House, in October 2019 and September 2022. He has won prizes at a number of well-respected composition competitions, such as the North London Festival, Berlioz International Music Competition and Chesham Arts Festival, as well as being shortlisted for the Benslow Music Trust. In March 2023, Edward was fortunate to have his arrangement of <i>Waltzing Matilda</i> performed at Westminster Abbey, at the pre-service to the Commonwealth Day. More recently, his collaborative work <i>Rhapsody for Sextet</i> has been performed numerous times by the London Sinfonietta in 2024, as part of their ‘Sound Out Schools’ outreach project. He has also had his music performed by the Carducci Quartet, Amersham Concert Club, Kucharsky Quartet, and the Chorleywood Orchestra, who premiered another of his orchestral works <i>Crenark Hill</i> in March 2024.</p>
				<p>He is an active musical entrepreneur, having planned and organized dozens of successful concerts, since the age of 17, most notably at the Purcell School and Amersham Free Church. These concerts have seen the premieres of well-received works like <i>Herbstlied</i> for solo piano, <i>Eclogue</i> for wind quintet, and several vocal settings of Shakespeare songs. He is the Principal Percussionist with the Chorleywood Orchestra, and has also performed with the Wycombe Festival Orchestra, Chalfont Wind Band, and the Hillingdon Philharmonic Orchestra. He also sings regularly with local choirs like the Chorleywood Choral Society, RAM Sings, and Amchor. He has also been active as a conductor, serving as the Music Director of the Purcell School’s award-winning outreach trip IMPULSE in 2023, as well as conducting the chamber ensemble Philomel during 2023 and 2024. He is a founding member of Expericademy, an experimental music ensemble, based at the Royal Academy of Music. He is also the Pianist in the Vigneron Trio, which he founded at Purcell in 2024, giving their debut in April that year. Upon graduating from Purcell in 2024, Edward was awarded the Tim Stevenson Prize, for his outstanding compositional and entrepreneurial work throughout his time at the school.</p>
				<p>On top of his concert music, Edward has also written film and electronic music, most notably re-scoring the 1902 silent film <i>Le Voyage dans la Lune</i>, by Georges Melies. He has also done plenty of arranging work, having produced the first complete arrangement of Holst’s <i>The Planets</i> suite, for solo piano, which was premiered in 2023. He is currently in the process of producing a similar arrangement of Mahler’s <i>Resurrection</i> Symphony.</p>
				<p>Edward has a sideline career building professional websites for individuals and small businesses, having founded the web development firm EPT Websites. He also founded the online debating platform CounterU, which is still currently in development. Additionally, he founded the film company Eskonfilm, also directing their debut film <i>Amersham Summer</i>, which was released in November 2024, as part of an ongoing film series accompanied by musical improvisations. He also writes the creative blog <i>At Home with the Craft</i>.</p>
				<p>He is currently residing in Amersham, and in his free time, he enjoys creative writing, reading, cycling, running and playing football, and he is a regular member of the RAM Football Club.</p>

				<p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Symphonic Transcriptions</b></p>
				<p>Edward and several other composers are in the ongoing process of re-imagining and arranging the greatest orchestral works for the accessibility and convenience of the solo piano. They plan to have concerts roughly twice a year, with one concert having already taken place in December 2023, featuring Edward's arrangement of <i>The Planets</i> suite by Gustav Holst, the first of its kind.</p>
				<p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Composers Parallels</b></p>
				<p>Music by one of the great well-known composers is performed, alongside new pieces which have been strongly influenced by this composer in different ways. A recent pairing was the chamber music of Dmitri Shostakovich with two new chamber works by Edward Tait and Antonia Zadrag, near the end of their time at the Purcell School. <!--The next leg of the project, called the <i>Triple Sonata</i>, will be performed later in 2025, and will feature music by Edward Tait, Samuel Kemp and Jacques Cohen, alongside that of J. S. Bach.--></p>
				<!-- FORTNIGHT PROJECT
				<p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Fortnight</b></p>
				<p>For 14 straight days, a group of composers and instrumentalists, including Edward, each write a 1-minute piece to be played and recorded by one of the other composers on their own instrument. These recordings are uploaded daily to Instagram and TikTok, and eventually, complete recordings of the 14 pieces on YouTube.</p>

				-->
				<p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>ImprovForty</b></p>
				<p>After experimenting with large-scale improvisation in his film <i>Amersham Summer</i>, Edward initiated a project, in which he recorded a new improvisation every day on the piano, for 40 days straight, with the aim of improving his pianistic fluency over that time. These improvisations were uploaded to YouTube every day. This project inspired a spin-off project, Edward Harris-Brown's <i>ImprovFifty</i>, following a similar model to the original. Tait himself followed with his own spin-off, a series of improvisations called <i>Scriabi-visations</i>, focusing on improvising in the style of Alexander Scriabin, one of his favourite composers.</p>
				<!-- HIGHBURY SERIES
				<p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Highbury</b></p>
				<p>Edward is the author of the best-selling children's book <i>Highbury</i>, and the subsequent successful series of books that followed it, all published by Austin Macauley Publishers, since 2025.</p>
