      <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4">Full Biography</h2>
	  <p class="mb-4">Edward was born in Ruislip, London, and initially took piano lessons with <b>James Kellas</b>, before starting lessons in composition and music theory with <b>Andrew Melvin</b>. During this time, he grew an extensive knowledge of repertoire and compositional technique, and quickly went on to win the <b>Beacon Young Musician of the Year Award</b>.</p>
	  <p class="mb-4">He enrolled at the <b>Purcell School of Music</b> in 2017, under a Scholarship from the UK Music and Dance Scheme, where he studied with <b>Deborah Pritchard</b>, <b>Brian Elias</b> and <b>Jacques Cohen</b>. He was also invited to attend seminars by <b>Judith Weir</b>, <b>Robert Saxton</b>, <b>Zoe Martlew</b>, <b>Julian Anderson</b>, <b>Errollyn Wallen</b>, <b>Grace-Evangeline Mason</b>, <b>Daniel Fardon</b>, <b>Dru Masters</b>, <b>Simon Speare</b>, <b>Tonia Ko</b>, <b>Sylvia Lim</b>, and <b>Michael Small</b>. While at Purcell, he received performances of several of his earliest orchestral works, at leading London venues like <b>St John’s Smith Square</b>, <b>Hatfield House</b>, and the <b>Constance Pilkington Hall</b>, and was especially fortunate to have his arrangement of <i>Waltzing Matilda</i> performed at <b>Westminster Abbey</b>, at the pre-service to the Commonwealth Day in 2023.</p>
	  <p class="mb-4">In the Sixth Form, he was an active member of the school’s awarding-winning Creative Ensemble. He was made Principal Pianist in the second year, and contributed additionally as a conductor and composer. In their final concert in 2024, he received a performance of his ensemble piece <i>Ash Grove</i>, as well as also conducting a new work by award-winning composer <b>Yfat Soul Zisso</b>. Other highlights during his Purcell years include <b>Nicholas Daniel</b> conducting one of his orchestral works at St John’s Smith Square, a collaboration with <b>Peter Sheppard Skærved</b> on a solo violin suite, and a workshop and performance by the <b>Carducci Quartet</b>, at the Chiltern Arts Festival.</p>
	  <p class="mb-4">Edward has won prizes at a number of well-respected composition competitions, most notably at the <b>North London Festival</b>. Other awards include the Berlioz International Music Competition, Tiziano Rossetti Competition, and the Chesham Arts Festival, as well as being shortlisted for the Benslow Music Trust. His orchestral work <i>Fleeting Manhattan</i> was also shortlisted in the European Recording Orchestra’s 2024 Call for Scores, through which he received masterclasses with esteemed Hollywood composers <b>Conrad Pope</b> and <b>Christopher Young</b>, as well as resident composers of the <b>Film Scoring Academy of Europe</b>, Arthur Brouns and Francisco Rios.</p>
	  <p class="mb-4">He is the Timpanist at the <b>Chorleywood Orchestra</b>, and has also performed on Percussion with the Essex Chamber Orchestra, Opera Greenwich, City Wind Orchestra, Wycombe Festival Orchestra, Bridgewater Sinfonia, Rose Opera, Chalfont Wind Band, and the Hillingdon Philharmonic Orchestra. He has also previously sung with local choirs like the Chorleywood Choral Society, RAM Sings, and AmChor. In 2024, the Chorleywood Orchestra, under the baton of <b>Daniel Hogan</b>, premiered his orchestral work <i>Crenark Hill</i>, to great acclaim.</p>
	  <p class="mb-4">Edward is an active musical entrepreneur, having planned and organized dozens of successful concerts, since the age of 17, including regularly at the Purcell School and Amersham Free Church. These concerts have seen the premieres of his own works, as well as countless premieres of new works by other living composers. He was the Music Director of the Purcell School’s award-winning outreach trip <b>IMPULSE</b> in 2023, and, in the same year, conducted their chamber ensemble <b>Philomel</b>. He was invited by the <b>London Sinfonietta</b> to contribute his skills to their ‘Sound Out Schools’ outreach project. As part of the same project, he received a commission for a piece which incorporated musical material composed by young students, which went on to receive numerous performances at both the <b>Royal Festival Hall</b> and <b>Dugdale Arts Centre</b>. Upon graduating from Purcell in 2024, he was awarded the <b>Tim Stevenson Prize</b>, for his outstanding compositional and entrepreneurial work throughout his time at the school.</p>
	  <p class="mb-4">Edward has a growing reputation as a pianist, having given performances at the Amersham Free Church, Constance Pilkington Hall, and St Alkmund’s Church, Shrewsbury, specializing in the music of Ravel and Prokofiev. He continued his study of the piano under <b>Lidia Amorelli</b>, during his time at the Purcell School, and he receives current mentorship from <b>Edward Harris-Brown</b> and <b>James Mayhew</b>. He is also the Pianist in the <b>Vigneron Piano Trio</b>, which he set up in 2024, giving their debut in April that year.</p>
	  <p class="mb-4">Edward currently studies Composition at the <b>Royal Academy of Music</b>, under the tutelage of <b>Gareth Moorcraft</b> and <b>Louise Drewett</b>. He has received further 1-to-1 mentorship from <b>Eleanor Alberga</b> and <b>Rubens Askenar</b>, and has benefited greatly from seminars with <b>Nicola LeFanu</b>, <b>Huw Watkins</b>, <b>Augusta Read Thomas</b>, <b>Anna Meredith</b>, and <b>Ryan Latimer</b>. He has also had the opportunity to have his music workshopped by <b>Aaron Holloway-Nahum</b> and <b>Philip Cashian</b>. He is a founding member of <b>Expericademy</b>, an experimental music ensemble, which he set up during his first year at the Academy, to which he has contributed extensively as a composer, pianist and conductor.</p>
	  <p class="mb-4">Recent highlights outside of the Academy include his carol setting of <i>In the Bleak Midwinter</i> being performed at the <b>London Festival of Contemporary Church Music</b>, under the baton of <b>Alastair Carey</b>, in 2025, after being selected in their Call for Scores. He subsequently received a 1-to-1 seminar with their resident composer <b>Phillip Cooke</b>. Similarly, his piece <i>Shifting</i> for string trio was performed at the <b>Cambridge Summer Music Festival</b>, in Churchill College Chapel, following a workshop with Professor <b>Ewan Campbell</b> and members of the <b>Ligeti Quartet</b>. In addition, he has received performances at the <b>York Late Music Festival</b> and <b>Amersham Concert Club</b>, and by ensembles including the <b>Rotherham Symphony Orchestra</b>, <b>Lloyd’s Choir</b>, <b>Trio Amabile</b>, and the <b>Arquia Duo</b>. Current projects include a symphonic suite, commissioned by the Chorleywood Orchestra, for a performance in 2026, and a song cycle for voice and violin, based on an original cycle by Mollie Mardel.</p>
	  <p class="mb-4">In addition to his concert music, he also composes film and electronic music, most notably rescoring the 1902 silent film <i>Le Voyage dans la Lune</i>, by Georges Melies. He was an active participant in the 2025 Composition course at the <b>National Film and Television School</b>, curated by <b>Mathias Nielsen</b>. He has also done a lot of arranging, having written the first complete arrangement of <i>The Planets</i> suite by Gustav Holst, for solo piano, which premiered in 2023. He is currently in the process of producing similar arrangements of orchestral works by Debussy and Mahler.</p>
	  <p class="mb-4">Edward has a sideline career building professional websites for individuals and small businesses, having founded the web development company, <b>EPT Websites</b>. He is also the founder of <b>Eskonfilm Pictures</b>, directing their debut film <i>Amersham Summer</i> in 2024, as part of an ongoing film series accompanied by musical improvisations. He also writes the creative blog <b><i>At Home with the Craft</i></b>, and works as the Concert Marketing Manager at <b>Classical Futures Music Management</b>.</p>
