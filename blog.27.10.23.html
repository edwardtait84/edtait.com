        <p class="biography"><b>A Questionable Future</b><br>Blog Post from October 27th 2023</p>
        <br><p class="biography">I'm weighing between whether to become a composer or a lawyer. As a composer, or as a writer in general, I'm freer and independently-minded, have more of a direct legacy, and, in a stroke of luck, could make millions, from one big success. On the other hand, as a lawyer, it can still be just as rewarding to help small businesses against big government or big tech. It is also generally far better paid, if successful.</p>
        <br><p class="biography">Can you do both? Probably not very easily, as I'd be completely torn between the drastically different environments and circumstances required for these two different states of mind. A Liberal Arts course, as I've applied for at King's College, could work very well for either, so I'm glad I made that application.</p>
        <br><p class="biography">Hypothetically, as a lawyer, how would I use my other skills, composition and web development, to help me in this field? Could I set up a few of my own companies on the side, that focus on something as distantly-related of web development, and still retain my title as a “lawyer”? Imagine that my music is published through a company which I use to practice the law of copyright. This could be me as a professional lawyer. I could also have my own personal blog, in which I talk about all kinds of law, and through which I move onto plenty of other subjects which I love, including music, philosophy, enterprise, investing, web development, and railways. It could work, after all, it's best to consider every path!</p>
