    <p class="text">I have recently, as many of my readers know, taken a very strong interest in piano performing, and even started to consider it as the focus for a potential Masters degree. However, I had a strange, but also slightly self-affirming revelation, very recently. I've always been planning on trying to continue my piano and conducting, as well as even percussion and singing, as they all help to improve and regularly maintain my musical instincts, if not simply for 'playing the game' of the industry. I have, throughout all this, however, never even thought of viewing myself as a 'Pianist-Composer' or 'Composer & Conductor', or anything close to that. This is because there is an overwhelmingly clear focus on what I do, which is composing. Part of me found it really hard to put so much of my life, in previous years, into producing so many crucial piano arrangements, as I constantly worried that I would be made to look like I was making a point, or a statement about the purpose of music or something along those lines. As ironic as it is within my own career, I have become increasingly underwhelmed by the significance of my arrangements, as terrible as that sounds. This is not because I don't think they aren't very useful, but that they are nothing close to being inspired in any way. In this light, I do not consider myself anything of a true 'pianist', and for the record, I believe that absolutely nothing, not even my own prized arrangements, matches the fire and beauty of Holst's The Planets and Debussy's Trois Nocturnes. My passion does not lay within the compositional techinques of the instrument, but instead, in the very aesthetics of the music itself. I see my small-time conducting work as my best and most clear-cut way of proving this, taking emphasis of the piano, and creating balance. The purpose of this is simple, to pave the path for what I really want to do, becoming a composer.</p>

    <p class="text">I had a very thought-provoking lesson with my composition professor, Gareth, yesterday. The piece I showed him was my recently-completed solo violin suite. Many sections of it are strongly inspired by some of the post-Romantic virtuoso violin writing, seen in Ysaye and Prokofiev, and other similar composers. His main thought was that some sections of the piece didn't "fit", especially the tecniques that were very over-characteristic of this genre of music, or in other words, too overly "violinistic". As for style and purpose of the piece, he told me that "If it is referencial, it's got to make a point." That's something I've been thinking about ever since. The amount of pastiche that I've written over the past couple of years is hard to define in and of itself, as so much of it bears heavy influence from other composers, without being purposefully pastiche. Personally, I have always looked at the word with great confusion and ambiguity. I don't like its over-use, as it's very oversimplified, and is often thrown at things that are not completely without influence, or "forging their own path", as most music, incidently, actually does not.</p>

    <p class="text">I am, and have been, working on a large writing project for quite a while. It's based around nostalgic tales of pet cats from my childhood. Sadly, I've started becoming stifled in my flow of work, and I think the only effective way to become inspired again, from a writing perspective, is to take a large walk out in the country, like the early days of the lockdown, memorable indeed. That helped me all the time with my composing, and definitely with any kind of academic or school work. At the moment, all I can do is try to do as many newly-found activities as I can, as that will hopefully, by natural selection, bring me prosperity with the ones that I am naturally suited to. Part of me is still conflicted over all of this, however. I've lost a very important person in my life, and after everything we've been through together, I'm starting to ask myself, what am I actually doing all of this for? Myself? A future version of myself? The world? My friends? My enemies? If I do actually publish a novel, what next? I'm not a proficient enough writer to realistically keep it up as a professional, and therefore, having spent thousands of hours on this one project, what else do I do? I'll be sacrificing a painfully large number of hours. Is it worth it? I'll try and hold faith in the notion that it is...</p>

    <p class="text">I've had a whack-load of bad news over the past few days. Most of all, the classic adolescent milestone of the break-up. I'm not sure whether I want to enter music as a profession anymore. It's extremely unstable, and depends on the fragility of connections, contacts and good reputation, with damaging consequences leading to ending up on the wrong end of this success. I recently started with my first regular piano students. Teaching, especially piano, is going to be very much a working process for me, as I often struggle with professional communication, outside of planned and ready-prepared and written speeches at the start of concerts. It is, however, as I have seen with my former teachers, very satisfying once you develop a strong teacher-student relationship, as it's easier to get into the flow, and teach better and more comfortably. And of course, students need money! I recently started developing a new business, with my business partner, which is a new website designed to hopefully increase the amount of rational debate in this increasingly 'shouty' world. It'll be plenty of work, and likely take a long time, but I'm going to have a go. It's great to have big projects like this, something which I have greatly doing recently, and especially now, as I need to crack down and work, if I'm going to take my mind off other affairs.</p>

    <p class="text">While recently writing a solo violin suite, I suddenly had a thought. Why do musicians love playing their instrument? Is it due to the physical process of playing, or the process of the piece of music itself? Or perhaps, quite simply, the vast body of great repertoire for their instrument? This will naturally have multiple answers, which begs another question... There is a lot of new music that uses every single extended technique in the book, even those that feel uncomfortable and displeasing to play on the instrument. For those who value the meditation in the physicality of playing their instrument, are some of these extended techniques perhaps taking it a bit too far, and even removing much of the enjoyment out of playing? I think it ultimately comes down to the debate of whether the composer's or performer's opinion is of more value. While an extended technique might be troubling for an instrumentalist, it might sound very inventive or even beautiful to the listener, in many cases. In many other cases, however, this appreciation from the listener is not even the case at all, which is how we end up with so many works of new music falling into the danger zone, too far from any kind of public accessibility.</p>

    <p class="text">It is approaching midnight, and the new year, and therefore, I have a random thought to share, that I've been pondering over for a while. When I was at Purcell, I remember there was a big push amongst composers to try and find out "voice" and artistic identity. I even got criticised many times for writing music that was too "similar in style" to other composers. This is, to an extent, the sad case where I'm studying at the moment, at the Academy. I always felt that it doesn't matter what "style" I write in, because hopefully after a while, my voice will shine through, without me even having to try. I haven't found my musical identity yet. All I can do until that point is simply try to keep writing beautiful music. For Christmas, I recently watched the classic 'Wallace & Gromit' films. Naturally paying attention to the amazing soundtrack, so creative and inventive, I realized how much I would love to compose a score to films as great as this! Let's hope that, over the next few years, I can actually follow that ambition through!</p>

    <p class="text">Yesterday, I wrote a poem about the American folklore, the Windigo. As the first poem I wrote in about 3 years, it was alright. I think I’ve still got quite a way to go, however. Christmas is just a few days away. Coming to an end, it has really made me realize that I haven’t done anything near what I wanted to achieve this year. I feel like I sort of backed out of A-levels, and could have absolutely done a lot better. I’m at a great place where I am, even if not York, but I still feel as though I haven’t got much to show for myself. I’ve been writing this book, on and off, about the village of Highbury. I’m hoping that could become something. My website-making service is kind of coming back to kick me. I’m quite behind on a couple of websites that are supposed to be finished within a few days. Maybe it’s not for me. I enjoyed it for a while, but maybe I should just focus on my own, and a select few others, in my own free time. The very first one I made, for a trio of friends at Academy, I’ve had to take down anyway, as they’re splitting up.</p>

    <p class="text">Although having recently rethought my life, and decided to become an entrepreneur, there is still, and always, going to be a very important artistic side to my personality. My hopeful success in my 'career' will not change the fact that the artistic side of me will still remain as strong as before. Becoming an entrepreneur does not at all mean that my attitude towards art is changing, or that my priority in the world of art will be making money. It simply means that I will take the focus off of any single study, even composition. I have a lot of passions and interests, and I will dare to, for the life of me, give them all a go. I am also in no way at all turning my back on the music industry or the artistic practice. I am going to keep composing and writing and filmmaking and performing music for as long as I live, but simply harness it as an activity and practice that makes me money, and allows me to take initative. Or so to speak, I have an entrepreneurial approach towards art and creativity. Funnily enough, I was in the middle of writing a set of Piano Inventions, thinking about why I've been so stuck in the music of my influences, when I had this significant revelation, or better put, epiphany. Funny how things that happen if you ask me!</p>

    <p class="text">I have two contrasting views to share. Firstly, I think one of the beauties of composition is that a piece of music, whilst in the process of being written, can follow you through and reflect everything that occurs in and upon your life. For example, while writing my “String Trio” or my “Fantasia-Elegy”, I feel like every bit of it perfectly reflects the states and trajectory of my own personal experiences, yet by the end of completion, I have a completely abstract and pure piece of music, which I can reflect on, and more importantly, RELATE to, as it’s followed me and carried me through so much. On the other hand, I must share the important and arguable but unofficial “narrative” behind my String Trio. Under this narrative, the three movements can be seen as the three stages of “the development of an artist’s voice”. The first movement, energetic and almost brutal, symbolizes youth and the imitation of a musical style, in this case, Shostakovich, based on my own personal experiences. Despite the contrasting texture of writing towards the end of this movement, this “youthful” characterization stays mostly in place. The second movement is slow and grounded, like an uncompromisingly long and painful elegy. Ideas develop slowly and almost entirely out of each other over a linear narrative. The third and final movement is the longest of the three, in stark contrast to the traditional practice of the “Scherzo” third movement. The piece is instead a long fantasia, with several different overlapping forms and structures baked into it, despite not being easily categorizable. Its structure does, however, work as a movement of a chamber work. This is, after all, the main point of music, as it truly works. I like to think of this final movement as the artist finally reaching his point of finding his own voice. Just like the movement itself, with its noticeably different overall mood and texture to the other two movements, it’s as if all the melodies and harmonies and motifs have all finally been processed into a fully-formed piece of music, one which the fictional “artist” can be proud to call “in their own voice”. This complex but fairly abstract narrative is, in my opinion, one of the main reasons why I feel this is my first “masterpiece” or “great work”. It’s certainly the piece which I’d say “characterizes an important period of my own life, meaning the artistic coming-of-age, and discovery of my own personal voice”. I’ve come to the realisation of what I’ll consider my second “great work”, which is my orchestral concert overture Crenark Hill, which I’m hoping to get perform soon. If I’m going to establish myself as a unique and uniquely personal composer, then Crenark Hill reflects this more than anything. The entire piece, more or less, alternates between tonic and dominant chords, and there’s almost no harmonic progression, except that of motific progression. That’s what I feel makes this piece so unique. Once performed and published, I think it’ll be one of the pieces that’ll build up my name and unique qualities as a composer. The piece is being performed in March, by the way, in Chorleywood, which I’ll keep you all posted on!</p>

    <p class="text">I’m thinking of planning concerts to perform my String Trio and arrangement of The Planets. I’d better get in there early before I run into the classic procrastination mode. Under my belief that music is the greatest and purest form of art, I’ve had a thought. If music is unique for being the only art form that’s measured in time, then interactive music can only diminish music’s unique power. It also takes away so much of the composer’s identity from his own music. Maybe tech’s the route of this. Attention spans for most can’t cover any works of art longer than 5 minutes, and art can’t be appreciated if it’s not recognised or heard in full, because if a work of music is structured properly, then it should, by nature, feel incomplete when listening to it in sections.</p>

    <p class="text">This is my second-last lesson with Mr. Simmonds, and he tells me that he was a composer when he was a student at Keele. This led to a long conversation about university. I’ve been comparing conservatoire and university up until this point, but he said that I’ve got the right idea thinking more about university. As an artist himself, I half-believed him when he said that all the activity and speculation around the music of today happens when you get to university. He even helped me personally as a composer, saying that I need to find my own personally voice, or musical language. As I’ve come to agree, every composer must have their own language of writing, as it’s what gives them their purpose towards art. We inevitably got onto Shostakovich, who’s music I love at the moment, and I discovered that he played the cello in Shostakovich’s Fifth, which he also loved. Our last lesson with him really completed the cycle of what I needed to know my place as a composer. He showed us a couple of his compositions from his days as a student, a violin sonata, and a piece for wind quintet. Following on from that, as we summed up our year’s work of studying, he gave us all some of the best advice and reassurance we could ever need: “Whatever anyone will tell you, what I’m about to tell you is so important; the true way to measure a society is by its treatment, its attitude towards its art. And most art doesn’t impact a lot of people, and that’s fine, that doesn’t matter. Every piece of art, or work of literature, or piece of music that you create will have an impact. It’ll raise a question, or state an idea. And this is, I can’t stress enough how important that is, to us as humans. That’s why what you, all you people do as musicians, like all artists, is so important.” All I can say from that, is that one thing can be certain. whatever the future brings for me, or whatever I study, or work for, or whoever I’m friends with, and whoever I know, or am associated with, I’ll never separate from my music, or give up my art. My music is my expression, my identity, my lifelong passion, and at the end of it all, my legacy, and nothing, no force in the world, can block me from that asset. I gave him a copy of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, signed by everyone in that small class of six of us. We then shook hands, and he wished me good luck! I really wish I’d thanked him more, as much as he’s really helped me.</p>

    <p class="text">A few days ago, one of my good friends at school, Dexter, suggested I watch a new film, called Empire of the Sun. I did, and it was fantastic, possibly close to one of the best films ever created, for its acting, directing, and of course, its music. Over these past few days, whatever I did, I couldn’t get the themes and music of Empire of the Sun out of my head, but particularly the music. It was lodged inside of my brain like an earworm. At this point I’m beginning to realize something, that I must do music. I must be a composer. It became so clear in my mind at that point, as if everything I’m doing outside of it, like coding, investing, business, railway modelling, and whatever else I want or need, is all to serve what I am as a composer. After all, I’m going to need I proper legacy, better yet a proper artistic one! To tell the truth, this was always going to be realised at some point. I had a dream, which depicted the death of one of my loved ones, and somehow, in that dream, it made me question everything. Most importantly, however, the thing I figured out was that I need to keep myself living on, through a legacy. And what other better legacy than through music!</p>

    <p class="text">My long-time history teacher, Mr. Pigott, has just announced to us that he’s leaving. It’s apparently not confirmed, according to a student at school, but I’m pretty sure it almost definitely is. In all seriousness, I’m going to miss him. He was well-read and well-spoken, and was a great source of inspiration to me over the years, in more than just history. He was also an inspiration to me, strangely, in music, railways, and just generally regarding my interests during my growing up. He was often hilariously sarcastic and satirical and cynically of plenty of things, in the funniest way that you can imagine, and often even just through his facial expressions. Also, he often replied in his knowledgeable wisdom “no, no, difference is good; some variety is good…” and would go on to explain his opinion and thoughts through his massive brain-based library of knowledge. He’d been fine, in fact comedically enthusiastic, just like my English teacher Mr. Simmonds, about any of us, although me and Dexter in particular, bringing cups of tea into class.</p>

    <p class="text">I’d like to give a mention to one of my favourite pieces of music at the moment, which is The Planets by Gustav Holst. When talking about this subject, my composition teacher Jacques Cohen described The Planets as “a fantastic suite of seven unique tone poems”, which I agree with completely, and I think that sums up a lot of the reason as to why I love them so much. I’m even thinking about arranging it for solo piano, as I’ve been putting together some sketches straight onto the piano, which I might write up onto Sibelius. Jacques is an amazing composition teacher. He’ll say phrases like “anyway, we digress…” and “short is fine, short is good” which, from now on, I’ll never be able to forget, even after I leave the Purcell School, as part of my process of composition! Whenever I remind him, at the start of each week’s lesson, of which pieces I was working on, he had this facial expression, which merged into one of either ambiguity or confusion. I couldn’t put my finger on it, by which point he’d remember anyway. He would use emotive language, in the context of anything we were working on, but in a “factual” way, almost never, until this point at least, using a strong voice or expression, keeping precisely to the point. What a legend! Samuel Kemp, Josh Gearing, and myself are all quite good friends, as we collectively made up the majority of Jacques’s regular students. All of us know his uniquely personal obsession with the green paper cups used at school, mostly for drinking tea and coffee out of, which for some reason we remember!</p>

    <p class="text">I need to reflect on my time studying with, and what I’ve so far learned from my new English teacher, Mr. Adam Simmonds. This term alone has brought me enough to shape my new view of life, as not knowing exactly what I want to do as a career in the future, but as long as I believe in the power and importance of art. I only partially remember his first few classes, and that most of it was simply occupied with learning about and understanding the context behind pre-Civil War, or “antebellum”, American literature. I did, however, notice his unique style of teaching. Even just the way he explained the cultural divide between Northern and Southern states, which, although I knew a lot of it already, I really started to understand a more human and psychological perspective, rather than just a string of events and historical facts. But it took me a while to actually put my finger on exactly what I found intriguing about his lessons, and what gave me a great amount of anticipation in what I’d discover with the next lesson, almost every lesson. Now at least I know, that after all these years of doubt, I’ve definitely picked the right school!</p>
