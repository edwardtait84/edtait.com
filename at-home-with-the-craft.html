    <p class="text">I have recently, as many of my readers know, taken a very strong interest in piano performing, and even started to consider it as the focus for a potential Masters degree. However, I had a strange, but also slightly self-affirming revelation, very recently. I've always been planning on trying to continue my piano and conducting, as well as even percussion and singing, as they all help to improve and regularly maintain my musical instincts, if not simply for 'playing the game' of the industry. I have, throughout all this, however, never even thought of viewing myself as a 'Pianist-Composer' or 'Composer & Conductor', or anything close to that. This is because there is an overwhelmingly clear focus on what I do, which is composing. Part of me found it really hard to put so much of my life, in previous years, into producing so many crucial piano arrangements, as I constantly worried that I would be made to look like I was making a point, or a statement about the purpose of music or something along those lines. As ironic as it is within my own career, I have become increasingly underwhelmed by the significance of my arrangements, as terrible as that sounds. This is not because I don't think they aren't very useful, but that they are nothing close to being inspired in any way. In this light, I do not consider myself anything of a true 'pianist', and for the record, I believe that absolutely nothing, not even my own prized arrangements, matches the fire and beauty of Holst's The Planets and Debussy's Trois Nocturnes. My passion does not lay within the compositional techinques of the instrument, but instead, in the very aesthetics of the music itself. I see my small-time conducting work as my best and most clear-cut way of proving this, taking emphasis of the piano, and creating balance. The purpose of this is simple, to pave the path for what I really want to do, becoming a composer.</p>

    <p class="text">I had a very thought-provoking lesson with my composition professor, Gareth, yesterday. The piece I showed him was my recently-completed solo violin suite. Many sections of it are strongly inspired by some of the post-Romantic virtuoso violin writing, seen in Ysaye and Prokofiev, and other similar composers. His main thought was that some sections of the piece didn't "fit", especially the tecniques that were very over-characteristic of this genre of music, or in other words, too overly "violinistic". As for style and purpose of the piece, he told me that "If it is referencial, it's got to make a point." That's something I've been thinking about ever since. The amount of pastiche that I've written over the past couple of years is hard to define in and of itself, as so much of it bears heavy influence from other composers, without being purposefully pastiche. Personally, I have always looked at the word with great confusion and ambiguity. I don't like its over-use, as it's very oversimplified, and is often thrown at things that are not completely without influence, or "forging their own path", as most music, incidently, actually does not.</p>

    <p class="text">I am, and have been, working on a large writing project for quite a while. It's based around nostalgic tales of pet cats from my childhood. Sadly, I've started becoming stifled in my flow of work, and I think the only effective way to become inspired again, from a writing perspective, is to take a large walk out in the country, like the early days of the lockdown, memorable indeed. That helped me all the time with my composing, and definitely with any kind of academic or school work. At the moment, all I can do is try to do as many newly-found activities as I can, as that will hopefully, by natural selection, bring me prosperity with the ones that I am naturally suited to. Part of me is still conflicted over all of this, however. I've lost a very important person in my life, and after everything we've been through together, I'm starting to ask myself, what am I actually doing all of this for? Myself? A future version of myself? The world? My friends? My enemies? If I do actually publish a novel, what next? I'm not a proficient enough writer to realistically keep it up as a professional, and therefore, having spent thousands of hours on this one project, what else do I do? I'll be sacrificing a painfully large number of hours. Is it worth it? I'll try and hold faith in the notion that it is...</p>

    <p class="text">I've had a whack-load of bad news over the past few days. Most of all, the classic adolescent milestone of the break-up. I'm not sure whether I want to enter music as a profession anymore. It's extremely unstable, and depends on the fragility of connections, contacts and good reputation, with damaging consequences leading to ending up on the wrong end of this success. I recently started with my first regular piano students. Teaching, especially piano, is going to be very much a working process for me, as I often struggle with professional communication, outside of planned and ready-prepared and written speeches at the start of concerts. It is, however, as I have seen with my former teachers, very satisfying once you develop a strong teacher-student relationship, as it's easier to get into the flow, and teach better and more comfortably. And of course, students need money! I recently started developing a new business, with my business partner, which is a new website designed to hopefully increase the amount of rational debate in this increasingly 'shouty' world. It'll be plenty of work, and likely take a long time, but I'm going to have a go. It's great to have big projects like this, something which I have greatly doing recently, and especially now, as I need to crack down and work, if I'm going to take my mind off other affairs.</p>

    <p class="text">While recently writing a solo violin suite, I suddenly had a thought. Why do musicians love playing their instrument? Is it due to the physical process of playing, or the process of the piece of music itself? Or perhaps, quite simply, the vast body of great repertoire for their instrument? This will naturally have multiple answers, which begs another question... There is a lot of new music that uses every single extended technique in the book, even those that feel uncomfortable and displeasing to play on the instrument. For those who value the meditation in the physicality of playing their instrument, are some of these extended techniques perhaps taking it a bit too far, and even removing much of the enjoyment out of playing? I think it ultimately comes down to the debate of whether the composer's or performer's opinion is of more value. While an extended technique might be troubling for an instrumentalist, it might sound very inventive or even beautiful to the listener, in many cases. In many other cases, however, this appreciation from the listener is not even the case at all, which is how we end up with so many works of new music falling into the danger zone, too far from any kind of public accessibility.</p>

    <p class="text">It is approaching midnight, and the new year, and therefore, I have a random thought to share, that I've been pondering over for a while. When I was at Purcell, I remember there was a big push amongst composers to try and find out "voice" and artistic identity. I even got criticised many times for writing music that was too "similar in style" to other composers. This is, to an extent, the sad case where I'm studying at the moment, at the Academy. I always felt that it doesn't matter what "style" I write in, because hopefully after a while, my voice will shine through, without me even having to try. I haven't found my musical identity yet. All I can do until that point is simply try to keep writing beautiful music. For Christmas, I recently watched the classic 'Wallace & Gromit' films. Naturally paying attention to the amazing soundtrack, so creative and inventive, I realized how much I would love to compose a score to films as great as this! Let's hope that, over the next few years, I can actually follow that ambition through!</p>

    <p class="text">Yesterday, I wrote a poem about the American folklore, the Windigo. As the first poem I wrote in about 3 years, it was alright. I think I’ve still got quite a way to go, however. Christmas is just a few days away. Coming to an end, it has really made me realize that I haven’t done anything near what I wanted to achieve this year. I feel like I sort of backed out of A-levels, and could have absolutely done a lot better. I’m at a great place where I am, even if not York, but I still feel as though I haven’t got much to show for myself. I’ve been writing this book, on and off, about the village of Highbury. I’m hoping that could become something. My website-making service is kind of coming back to kick me. I’m quite behind on a couple of websites that are supposed to be finished within a few days. Maybe it’s not for me. I enjoyed it for a while, but maybe I should just focus on my own, and a select few others, in my own free time. The very first one I made, for a trio of friends at Academy, I’ve had to take down anyway, as they’re splitting up.</p>
