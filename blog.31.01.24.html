        <p class="biography"><b>What forms an Artist's Voice?</b><br>Blog Post from January 31st 2024</p>
        <br><p class="biography">A couple of days ago, I heard a piece by a friend of mine, Aaron Stewart, called “Sonata in Two Movements”, and it made me think that I need to start to focus on crafting and orchestrating my music better, and working with the performers closer. As a result, I’m going to start going through a lot of my music, past and current music, with several musicians that I know.</p>
        <br><p class="biography">I’ve also started to realize, just as a side note, that my style of composition has been largely influenced by plenty of other composers, but that now, my own “voice” is beginning to emerge, something which I’m also going to lean into, in order to develop as a composer, especially going into my years of further education.</p>
        <br><p class="biography">I’ve been working on a certain composition for a while now, for Cello and Piano, called Latimer’s Edge, which is like a nostalgic “pastoral English” fantasia. There’s a chord progression in it which I can’t get out of my head, going from C-F#-B-D to B-E-A-D. Something about this progression just somehow screams nostalgia for English countryside, so much that there’s something almost reminiscent of Vaughan-Williams or even Butterworth. I just can’t quite put my finger on it! However, I might use this chord a few times, particularly in my “English” music, as I’ve noted its effectiveness, and couldn’t be a better symbol of my unique voice as a composer, once again, stemming from my nation, which I’m not at all ashamed of.</p>
