        <p class="biography"><b>Empire of the Sun</b><br>Blog Post from May 8th 2023</p>
        <br><p class="biography">A few days ago, one of my good friends at school, Dexter, suggested I watch a new film, called Empire of the Sun. I did, and it was fantastic, possibly close to one of the best films ever created, for its acting, directing, and of course, its music. Over these past few days, whatever I did, I couldn't get the themes and music of Empire of the Sun out of my head, but particularly the music. It was lodged inside of my brain like an earworm. At this point I'm beginning to realize something, that I must do music. I must be a composer. It became so clear in my mind at that point, as if everything I'm doing outside of it, like coding, investing, business, railway modelling, and whatever else I want or need, is all to serve what I am as a composer. After all, I'm going to need I proper legacy, better yet a proper artistic one!</p>
