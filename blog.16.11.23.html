        <p class="biography"><b>Favourite Composers?</b><br>Blog Post from November 16th 2023</p>
        <br><p class="biography">It's past midnight now, and I'm with Yulin and we're listening to the Adagietto from Mahler's Fifth Symphony, one of my personal gems of Mahler. I would say he's one of my favourite composers, but in reality, I can't put composers in groups of priorities like this.</p>
        <br><p class="biography">For example, whenever I try to name my favourite composers, which for the last few years, have technically “been” Ravel, Shostakovich and Vaughan-Williams, all for different reasons. However, I'd now have to add Holst and even Elgar for their just-as-good orchestration and passionate music and wide range of style within their own voice. Furthermore, if I did that, I'd also have to add Mahler, because he's simply the greatest symphonist after Beethoven, another composer who I'd have to add as a result. This kind of proves my point!</p>
        <br><p class="biography">This is the beauty of composition. I don't just have a select few composers as my “biggest influences”, although I lean more towards certain ones through certain periods of my life. For example, at the current moment, these “influences” would probably be Shostakovich and Ravel, but that's changed from the past, and will definitely continue to change as I grow more as a composer. Through all the other composers I know and love, and all artistic and cultural influences I am exposed to, I'll find my own unique and personal “voice” one day. This day can't really be defined, but instead, this quality within me will slowly unravel out into my composition.</p>
